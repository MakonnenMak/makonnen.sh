      <description>The Highlights Reel This year&amp;rsquo;s been quite the ride, kicking off with a new bundle of joy in the family (sorry Sari, your nickname suggestion didn&amp;rsquo;t make the cut), followed by a lively baptism celebration. My sisters and old Alexandria buddies made their way to NYC, and the uni crew stuck to our annual hangout tradition. Oh, and I finally set foot in Europe for an ACM Security conference in Copenhagen - cold but fun!</description>

      <description>I always bring up this comic book to my sister since she canâ€™t for the life of her, remember reading it. Although we read it all the time since it was one of the few colored comic books our library had more than a decade ago.&#xA;I honestly just remember a few things:&#xA;Goofy and whimsical main character, outwits all her enemies Strange pirate crew. They were all weird. But fun.</description>
