  <h2 class="articleTitle">Mafia - Dynamics of Trust and Influence</h2>
  <p>In <em>Mafia</em>—also known as <em>Werewolf</em>—players assume secret roles that create a high-stakes game of deception and deduction. The mafia members, who know each other’s identities, work together to eliminate villagers without revealing their roles. Villagers, including special roles like the seer and healer, must identify the mafia while protecting themselves.</p>
<p>The game shows the power of knowledge with manipulation. Mafia members use their insider information to strategize and create confusion. This mirrors how a knowledgeable minority can shape public opinion.</p>
