  <p>I’ve got one uncle who seems to be the unofficial guardian of the highways. Out of the blue, he’ll call you up just to let you know that traffic is jammed at some random intersection you haven’t seen in months. He just can’t help but keep everyone updated. More often than not they surprisingly end up being useful and ahead of news reports themselves. Every time we get these updates they&rsquo;re kind of funny and oddly comforting at the same time.</p>
