  <h2 class="articleTitle">Reflections from this year</h2>
  <h2 id="the-highlights-reel">The <em>H</em>ighlights Reel</h2>
<p>This year&rsquo;s been quite the ride, kicking off with a new bundle of joy in the family (sorry Sari, your nickname suggestion didn&rsquo;t make the cut), followed by a lively baptism celebration. My sisters and old Alexandria buddies made their way to NYC, and the uni crew stuck to our annual hangout tradition. Oh, and I finally set foot in Europe for an ACM Security conference in Copenhagen - cold but fun! Explored Seattle with family, hit up San Francisco twice for work friends, and grooved to some killer concerts - Hailu Mergia and Sampha in NYC were absolute highlights.</p>
<h2 id="lifes-little-adventures">Life&rsquo;s Little Adventures</h2>
<p>On the home front, I&rsquo;ve been channeling my inner chef with some hand-crafted recipes, though nothing beats my classic Aeropress coffee. Sunday school became my weekly spiritual pitstop, really beefing up my faith game. Career-wise, I leveled up in growth engineering - turns out I can be pretty persuasive with stakeholders when I put my mind to it. Health and fitness? Well, I&rsquo;m lifting more regularly and taking long walks, but let&rsquo;s just say my diet&rsquo;s still a work in progress. As for last year&rsquo;s goals, coding passion? Check. Mentorship? Got some eye-opening feedback. Personal projects and music comebacks? Uh&hellip; let&rsquo;s move on, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>Looking at 2024, I&rsquo;m all about that consistency in exercise and diet - almost there, just need to push a bit more. The eternal struggle with sleep continues, but this year, I&rsquo;m determined to crack that code. I&rsquo;m on a mission to rediscover the fun in coding and cement my status as a senior programmer. Music? No more excuses, I&rsquo;m diving back in. Travel&rsquo;s on the agenda too - eyeing a major Canadian city, some iconic American spots like Texas and SoCal, and maybe an international adventure. Oh, and about Ethiopia - the political situation&rsquo;s been pretty rough, affecting a lot of ordinary folks. I want to help somehow, but without diving headfirst into the political mosh pit - my brain&rsquo;s still intact, thank you very much.</p>
<p>As this year wraps up, I&rsquo;m just grateful for the awesome friends and family in my life. Each one&rsquo;s like a note in this crazy symphony of existence, and together, they&rsquo;ve painted one heck of a picture. Here&rsquo;s to carrying these memories into the new year and striding forward with determination. Thanks for sticking around this far, folks!</p>
<h2 id="waiting-for-others-to-post-theirs-">Waiting for other&rsquo;s to post theirs &hellip;</h2>
<p><em>Yonathan&rsquo;s article will be dropped here once it&rsquo;s in my inbox&hellip; any moment now&hellip;</em>
<em>Still waitingâ€¦</em>
<em>Month into 2024, still waiting&hellip;</em>
<em>Three months into 2024, waiting&hellip;</em></p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t hold your breath, folks. Yonathan&rsquo;s wisdom might arrive sometime between now and the heat death of the universe. In the meantime, feel free to admire this blank space and imagine all the profound thoughts that could potentially fill it.)</p>
