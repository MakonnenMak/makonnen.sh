SimpleTex - A language built with scala on top of LaTex with simpler syntax leaning towards a markdown-like syntax. Supported embedding LaTex for more advanced text formatting whilst coming out of the box supporting many general features used students writing in markdown day to day. Never completed, but made some decent progress during the covid times.
