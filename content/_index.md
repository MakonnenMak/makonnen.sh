Programmer. Another cini buna and macchiato drinker. Music listener. Currently based in NYC and spend a bit of time in Virginia as well.

Infinite cycles of learning then teaching. Learning theory then applying it. Strengthen your communities, break bread together and converse. Uplift the beauty in this world, too many things trying to do the opposite of that.

John 16:33
