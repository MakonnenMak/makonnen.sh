I always bring up this comic book to my sister since she canâ€™t for the life of her, remember reading it. Although we read it all the time since it was one of the few colored comic books our library had more than a decade ago.

I honestly just remember a few things:

Goofy and whimsical main character, outwits all her enemies
Strange pirate crew. They were all weird. But fun.
The candy physics planet. The image below is burned in my head for some odd reason..
