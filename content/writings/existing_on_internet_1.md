I haven’t posted on Instagram in about five years, and Lord knows when I last touched Facebook. At this point, there’s really no reason for anyone over 18 to have Snapchat installed - so that can be ignored. I still throw out the occasional tweet, but it’s mostly just a place for random notes now. Lately, I’ve been using BeReal a bit more - seems like a fun spot to hang out for now, but I even see it dying down as a fad.
TikTok lives are kinda fun, but I've only been in one or two so far.

This trend seems pretty common among the people I know: family, friends, and coworkers alike. Most folks I know are more into consuming and reacting to content rather than creating it. I wouldn’t be surprised if many of them have secret accounts or burner profiles they don’t talk about though.

I do miss the days when social media was all about sharing simple things like a slice of pizza on Instagram or a shower thought on Twitter. It used to feel more laid-back and fun. I am curious if this will ever come back or how this general trend of usage will affect my relationship with these platforms.
